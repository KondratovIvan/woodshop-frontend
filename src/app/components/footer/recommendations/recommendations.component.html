          <p class="contact-text">
            On our homepage, the “Recommended Products” carousel sits right at the top of the page. There you’ll see a handpicked selection of items chosen by our merchandising team for their quality, popularity, and seasonal appeal.<br />
            Simply scroll through the list before diving into categories—this quick overview helps you spot bestsellers and new arrivals without extra searching.<br /><br />

          <h4 class="contact-subtitle">2. How We Select Recommendations</h4>
          <p class="contact-text">
            We combine real customer feedback, purchase trends, and expert curation to build the recommended list. Each week, our team reviews top reviews, inventory levels, and emerging styles to refresh the selection.<br />
            This ensures you always see relevant products—whether it’s a trending gadget, a seasonal favorite, or a limited‑edition release.<br /><br />

          <h4 class="contact-subtitle">3. Spotting the Yellow Thumbs‑Up Badge</h4>
          <p class="contact-text">
            Every recommended item is marked with a bright yellow label featuring a thumbs‑up icon in the corner of its image. The badge makes it easy to identify our top picks at a glance, even on mobile screens.<br />
            Look for this icon to quickly filter out the noise and focus on products we believe you’ll love.
